* Explain browser utopia

* Disclaimers
	- I'm on the jQuery UI team.
	- This is a jQuery conference

* Haters Gonna hate

* Arguments that jQuery is no longer needed:
	- Native APIs (e.g. querySelectorAll) can do everything now
	- 28k is just too big, especially for mobile
	- Too slow

* DOM APIs / CSS can do everything now

	Traversal hell

	Can't loop
	Chaining is the SHIIIIIT

	- Show of hands - who could code an XMLHttpRequest

	Gotchas
		- DOM methods that return Live NodeLists: getElementsByTagName, getElementsByClassName
		- slicing every NodeList and caching its length before iterating (it's real slow and bad if you donâ€™t)
		- forEach
		- querySelectorAll mess
		- firstElementChild: http://jsfiddle.net/j3bfz/



* Too big / bloated (file size)
	- <script>: Download and parsing
		- Download speeds actually aren't bad, even on mobile
		- Single biggest problem is latency.
			- If you have JavaScript and you're concerned about performance you should have one <script> tag in the body.
			- DO NOT LOAD JQUERY FROM A CDN!!!!!!!
			- Size isn't all that important when downloading

	one less jpeg



	- Do not load all of jQuery UI!!!!
	- Do not load all of jQuery Mobile!!!
	- Size really isn't that important.

	- Parsing is
		- Stats

	- AMD


* Too slow

	"Remember, jQuery is an amazing library that makes all of our lives easier. But you should always choose to use native DOM methods if they are available to you."

	- Never prematurely optimize
		Premature optimization is the root of all evil -- DonaldKnuth

	- Show how slide up is so much easier.



Various pro arguments that I'm not sure where to put.
	- Clean APIs
	- Google-ability
	- Speed of getting things done ("write less, do more")

What you should do:
	- Concat scripts
	- Minify
	- gzip
